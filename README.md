Function Description:

This function is designed to perform a series of operations for data visualization and analysis using MATLAB scripts and functions. Below are the steps required to use this function:

Loading Data:
Load the required .mat data file into your MATLAB workspace. This file contains the data necessary for subsequent analysis and simulation.
Running the Simulation:
Execute the script sim_main.m by running it in MATLAB. This script processes the loaded data and sets up the environment for the simulation.
Drawing Figures:
Use the script draw_figure.m to generate figures for the paper. Ensure that this script is correctly configured to fetch results from the simulation output.
Network Flow Analysis:
The function BGf.m is essential for performing network flow analysis. This function does not require manual execution as part of the initial steps but is utilized by other scripts or functions as needed during their execution.
Ensure that all scripts and functions mentioned are in your MATLAB path or current working directory to avoid any issues during execution.
